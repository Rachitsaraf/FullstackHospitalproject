                            <p style="line-height:1.8;">
                                COVID-19 has put a serious risk on obese patients as compared to normal ones. The virus
                                is affecting
                                obese patients in a way that if they catch this infection, their survival rate is
                                reduced and the
                                complication rate is increased. According to data released by WHO, most of the people
                                who died from the
                                virus were obese or diabetic. There is an alarming situation for people suffering from
                                Obesity in the
                                entire world.
                                Amidst the serious conditions, there is another thing that has become a concern for
                                obese people. This
                                pandemic has brought a halt to Bariatric and Metabolic surgery and has delayed the
                                treatment of patients
                                suffering from obesity.
                                Obese people constantly find themselves at the bottom of every priority list and
                                struggle with bias. In
                                the lockdown, when people have to stay in their homes, binge eating has become common.
                                Obese people
                                can’t avoid eating more than usual and gaining weight sitting at their homes and doing
                                nothing. Also,
                                this fact that COVID-19 and lockdown have affected the financial condition of every
                                household that can’t
                                be neglected and is a serious cause of

                                            <p>In the time when COVID-19 is spreading like a wildfire, people who are
                                                morbidly obese have
                                                greater chances of catching the infection. But what can be the reason
                                                behind this? Dr. Mohit
                                                Bhandari explains the reasons why obesity and coronavirus are linked
                                                together. In our body,
                                                there are fat cells called “Adipocytes”. There are multiple receptors
                                                present on these fat
                                                cells. One receptor called Angiotensin is found the most in fatty cells.
                                                It is found that the
                                                affinity of the virus present in COVID-19 is more towards angiotensin
                                                receptors, which is why we
                                                can see the coronavirus affecting obese people more. The second reason
                                                is the improper working
                                                of the lungs in obese people. Breathing problems can be seen very
                                                commonly in obese patients due
                                                to which there are greater chances of developing Pneumonia. There are
                                                two types of immunity –
                                                innate immunity and acquired immunity. In obese people, Innate and
                                                Acquired Immunity both are
                                                less due to the deposition of fat. And because of low immunity, fighting
                                                with any type of virus
                                                becomes seriously low in obese people. If you are obese, overweight or
                                                morbidly obese, then take
                                                care of yourself the most because even in WHO, they have mentioned obese
                                                people to take great
                                                care of themselves as they have the highest chances of getting affected
                                                by it.</p>

                                            <p>After the lockdown was imposed all over the world, the government has
                                                declared to stop the
                                                elective surgeries until the time COVID-19 goes away. Elective surgeries
                                                are those surgeries
                                                that don’t involve a medical emergency, the procedures that are
                                                scheduled in advance, and need
                                                not be performed in a hurry. Government agencies suggested a temporary
                                                halt in elective
                                                surgeries amidst the COVID-19 emergency, which Dr. Mohit Bhandari feels
                                                is right. According to

                                            <p>China is a diabetes world capital. Nearly 32% of the COVID-19 cases were
                                                diabetic, and 10% of
                                                the diabetic patients died within 10 days. Because of diabetes, these
                                                patients survived lesser
                                                than normal people. According to Dr. Mohit Bhandari, Diabetes not only
                                                increased the death rate
                                                but also reduced the survival days of patients infected by a
                                                coronavirus.

                                                In India, 50-60% of the people who died were diabetic. In European
                                                countries, Diabetes is one of
                                                the biggest risk factors to catch COVID-19 infection. In America also,
                                                28 percent of people who
                                                died were diabetic.</p>

                                            <p>The patients who have undergone Bariatric Surgery in the past three, six,
                                                or twelve months have
                                                a most common query that what diet should be taken to combat COVID-19
                                                infection. According to
                                                Dr. Mohit Bhandari, the guidelines and diet plan that is given to you by
                                                your surgeon should be
                                                strictly followed after Bariatric Surgery. Apart from that, some
                                                important things need to be
                                                taken care of – Protein intake should be high. Proteins are structural
                                                core to fight any kind of
                                                infection. You should take nearly 1.5 grams of protein per kg of body
                                                weight. For example, 50 kg
                                                of body weight would require 75 grams of protein. Along with proteins,
                                                you need to take
                                                multivitamins that are suggested to you by your doctor.

                                                Consumption of zinc is important not only for bariatric surgery patients
                                                but also for normal
                                                people. Zinc forms a protective layer between the virus and the mucus
                                                membrane of your body. It
                                                also has anti-viral properties that have been stated in many research
                                                papers. Following the diet
                                                plan is given to you by your doctor, and taking basic safety measures
                                                can help you in combating
                                                the novel coronavirus infection. Stick to a healthy lifestyle and intake
                                                as many nutritions as
                                                you can.</p>

                                                Some hormones in our body
                                                secrete during infection. In diabetes patients, these hormones are

                                                normal people. That is why diabetic patients are affected the most by

                                                According to Dr. Mohit Bhandari, if your diabetes is not under control,
                                                and you are obese,
                                                then you have higher chances of getting the infection. Consult your
                                                doctor and keep your
                                                diabetes under control. To avoid the infection, keep a check on your
                                                abdominal obesity and
                                                Diabetes.</p>

                                                Patients-

                                                Breathing exercise- The patients who have been operated recently, should
                                                do deep breathing
                                                exercises daily. Not only those who have been operated recently but also
                                                those patients who went
                                                for Bariatric surgery in the last few years.

                                                Propensity to infection- After surgery, your lungs get better and there
                                                is less chance of
                                                getting the infection. But to keep your lungs functioning properly,
                                                sufficient nutrition and
                                                regular physical activity are necessary. Every patient should burn at
                                                least 350-500 kcal daily.

                                                Dr. Mohit Bhandari recommends following the diet given by your
                                                nutritionist, deep breathing
                                                exercises, and burning enough calories per day after the surgery. If
                                                this routine is followed
                                                strictly, the patient can prevent infections not only in present but in
                                                the future as well.</p>
